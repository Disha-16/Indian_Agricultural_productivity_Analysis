# Indian_Agricultural_productivity_Analysis_using _Ensemble_Learning
The objective of the project "Indian Agricultural Productivity Analysis" is to comprehensively assess and analyze the productivity trends and factors influencing agricultural output in India. Through rigorous data collection, statistical analysis, and interpretation, the project aims to uncover insights into the dynamics of agricultural productivity at regional, state, and national levels.


This dataset encompasses agricultural data for multiple crops cultivated across various states in India from the year 1997 till 2020. The dataset provides crucial features related to crop yield prediction, including crop types, crop years, cropping seasons, states, areas under cultivation, production quantities, annual rainfall, fertilizer usage, pesticide usage, and calculated yields.

Various operations like- year-wise,state-wise,season-wise,crop-wise analysis of agricultural product has been performed.As the data distribution have right skewness, one-hot encoding has been performed. Further,using 'Yoe-Johnson' method the power transformation operation has also been performed.


Linear Regressior,Support vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, CatBoost Regressor have been used to achieve the maximum accuracy on this dataset.

 
 Among all the regressor, Random Forest Regressor produce optimum occuracy with a training accuracy of 0.99 and a testing accuracy of 0.98
